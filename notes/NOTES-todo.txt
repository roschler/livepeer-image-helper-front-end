TODO NOTES

DEPLOYMENT:

    - Remember to change ALB path entry from /storytime to /chatbot !

NEXT:

    STORY PROTOCOL:

        - Need retry image request code, up to 3x, when a 503 error occurs

        - If time, try Jacob's API call to see if an asset is ready
         before opening the explorer page

        - Rejecting the mint and register transaction seems to hang
          the app.

        ? Chrome is blocking Twitter share popup.

        + Double-click on image shows "details pane".  Need to
          create hideable details pane and code to service the
          double-click event.

BUGS

- When the socket reconnects, get rid of the frowny face emoji
- Put the spinner underneath the status text.

- Modify back-end to convert PNGs to WEBPs when but AFTER
   we are ready to submit our contest entry!

- Everything works except for the images.  They are being
  generated on the server side, but the URL passed back
  is broken because it appears the storytime client
  renders the images by crafting a request URL through
  a route named "https://plasticeducator.com/nft-supreme/_next/image"
  and either we don't have it, or we broke the flow
  and need to fix it when making the client a pure
  client side static app.

SECURITY

- Need to add true server side session object.  Currently,
 that has been replaced with a dummy function that returns
 a static object to make the ReaderViewport component
 happy.  We will be using a wallet for our authorization.
